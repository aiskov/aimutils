# Personal Script Toolkit

This project is a collection of personal utilities written in Python and Bash, designed to simplify common tasks related 
to data processing, system administration, and cloud computing. The utilities cover a wide range of functions, from file 
management and data manipulation to Kafka routing, AWS management, and Linux system administration.

## Getting Started

To use the script, you'll need to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies. The `env.sh` 
script provided in this repository can help automate this process.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following software installed on your system:

- Bash (version 4 or higher)
- Python (version 3 or higher)
- pip (the Python package manager)
